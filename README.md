# What is this?

See project Euler: https://projecteuler.net

# Instructions

`julia startpluto.jl` and then select the `project_euler_*` file of you liking.

# I want to do it myself!

Check out https://github.com/heetbeet/project-euler-julia which provides the bare (pluto) templates containing the Euler problems.

# Disclaimer

The solutions aren't carefully optimized with respect to any objective. Hence, they (likely) aren't the fastest nor the most elegant (although I hope that some of them are fast and/or elegant).
